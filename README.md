I created more testcase locally using pandas on the whole dataset available on https://data.transportation.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Border-Crossing-Entry-Data/keg4-3bc2.
The task is just writing a groupBy query procedurally with some additional computation. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
